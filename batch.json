      "text": "Ah bearer of gourmet delights, glad you found the leisure to attend to my gastronomical requirements. I am feeling quite peckish, and a trifle breakfasty, if you get my drift, though it’s closer to lunch. Two eggs, lightly fried, sunny side up would just about hit the spot. And if you can manage some fried tomatoes, with bacon and sausages to go with it, my cup of joy will run over. And speaking of cups, a pot of black coffee, with a cosy to cover it, will be perfect. I will eschew sugar. Mildly diabetic, you know. Doctor’s orders. And an unchipped cup and saucer, Wedgwood or Royal Doulton preferably"
